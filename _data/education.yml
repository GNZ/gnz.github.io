    The National University of the South (in Spanish: Universidad Nacional del Sur, UNS) is the largest national university in southern Argentina. Its motto is Ardua Veritatem, which means "through the difficulties to the truth".

    The university was founded on January 5, 1956, and absorbed what had been the Technological Institute of South (Instituto Tecnológico del Sur, ITS), a former National University of La Plata affiliate established in 1946. Located in the city of Bahía Blanca, the school became the sixteenth in Argentina's national university system.

    During my time at the university, I learn from programming complex distributed applications to handle and analyse electronic circuits. The career was a combination between engineer bases, computer science and electronics. Thanks to that, I learn how to think of computer science as an engineer and with practical and theoretical knowledge about the underneath circuits and elements that run a program.

    I really enjoyed my time at uni, and always felt that I owe a lot to this incredible public institution. That's why I participated in different university's goverment bodies as an student, and worked as a undergraduated teaching assistant.

    I was elected as <strong>secretary</strong>, <strong>vicepresident</strong> and <strong>president of the Computer Science and Engineer Department Student Center</strong> (CECom), as a <strong>student member of the Council of the Computer Science and Enginner Department</strong> (DCIC) from 2012 to 2014, as a <strong>student member of the Council of the National University of the South</strong> (UNS) from 2013 to 2014, and as a <strong>student member of the Assembly of the National University of the South</strong> (UNS) during 2015.

    I loved the idea of improve the system for everyone at the university, impulse a better quality education, transmit our side of the story and connect with other people to think and launch lifechanging projects.

    I also felt in love with computers architectures and embedded systems, I would take optional courses about these subjects and try to go to conferences, unfortunatly I didn't have the oportunity to make it a professional path.

    Apart from all the courses I took during my degree I also took part in some others:
    - October 2013: Approved course, <mark>Applications development for Android mobile OS</mark>, University CAECE, CACIC, Mar del Plata, Argentina.
    - July 2012: Approved course, <mark>Mobile robotics II: Simultaneous localization and mapping</mark>, University of Buenos Aires, Escuela de Ciencias Informáticas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
    - July 2012: Approved course, <mark>Java for Real-Time software</mark>, University of Buenos Aires, Escuela de Ciencias Informáticas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    The final project of my career was <mark>Image acquisition and analysis of microscopes using Raspberry Pi and Android</mark> and you can find the code [here](https://github.com/GNZ/micro-api) and [here](https://github.com/GNZ/micro-android)
